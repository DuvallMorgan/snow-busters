## SnowBuster \- Product Requirements Document

# **Project name:** SnowBuster **Owner:** Paula, Annette, Michael, Josue, Duvall

# **Date:** January 27, 2026

### **Problem Statement**

# Homeowners and renters experience urgent snow removal needs during winter storms but lack a fast, reliable way to find available workers in their immediate area because existing platforms require extensive searching, vetting, and coordination, resulting in delayed help, missed work/appointments, potential safety hazards from uncleared walkways, and physical strain from attempting snow removal themselves.  Twenty percent of workers are unable to reach work, resulting in 

* \-20% Work Attendance: Estimates suggest that during major travel shutdowns, approximately one in five New Yorkers (20%) are unable to reach work or perform their jobs remotely, resulting in roughly $320 million in lost productivity for a single day.  
* \-70% Restaurant Revenue: Foot traffic at major city dining hubs can plummet by 70% or more during blizzards. Local restaurants often expect to lose at least 50% of an entire week's revenue due to a single weekend storm.  
* \-40% Commute Speeds: Snow or slushy pavement reduces average arterial road speeds by 30% to 40%, drastically increasing travel time and delaying essential services.  
* \-$700 Million Daily GDP Loss: A widespread single-day travel shutdown across New York State costs an estimated $700.17 million, with a large portion of that loss concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area due to lost retail sales and wages.  
* \-17% Road Safety Decline: Winter weather conditions in the NYC area contribute to a 17% increase in vehicle collisions, with approximately 24% of all weather-related crashes nationwide occurring on snowy or icy pavement.

### **Value Proposition**

# SnowBuster is an on-demand snow clearing dispatch platform for homeowners and renters that instantly connects them with verified local workers ready to clear snow within minutes, eliminating the stress and time waste of traditional service booking while providing workers with immediate earning opportunities during snow events.

### **Users and Needs**

# Primary user(s:

1. # Homeowners/renters needing snow clearing (Customers)

2. # Independent workers seeking snow clearing gigs (Workers)

# **Key user needs:**

# **Customer Personas:** 

# As a homeowner, I need to quickly request snow clearing service because I need to get to work/have a medical appointment and my car is buried

* # As a renter, I need transparent upfront pricing because I'm on a fixed budget and can't afford surprise costs

* # As an elderly person, I need reliable help because I physically cannot shovel snow safely

# **Worker: Personas:**

# As an independent contractor, I need to find snow clearing jobs quickly because snow clearing work is time-sensitive and competitive

* # As a gig worker, I need to see job details upfront (location, price, scope) because I need to maximize my earnings per hour

* # As a student, I need flexible work opportunities because I want to earn money during winter break without long-term commitments

# ---

### **Proposed Solution**

# SnowBuster is a two-sided marketplace web application that matches customers needing snow cleared with nearby workers in real-time. Customers submit a service request with their address and service type (driveway, walkway, car dig-out, or combo), see upfront pricing, and receive instant notifications when a worker accepts their job. Workers view available jobs in their area, accept jobs with one click, navigate to the location, complete the work, and mark jobs as complete to receive payment. The platform handles job matching, status tracking, and payment coordination through a simple, mobile-responsive interface.
